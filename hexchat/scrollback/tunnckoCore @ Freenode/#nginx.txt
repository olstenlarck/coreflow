T 1417543935 18<29d1plo1d18>	hey #nginx, I am trying to configure a load balancer so that it can start up even when one of it's backends is unavailable (ex. a totally unplugged backend server) and fail over to the remaining backends in that scenario. My nginx configuration works except when the backend fails, then it give me a "nginx: [emerg] host not found in upstream" and crashes. Is there anyway to ignore these and have it not crash?

T 1417545011 18<19bluenemo18>	hi guys. when using a  rewrite regex replacement flag  rule, how do I specify two flags? I'd like to set permanent as well as last
T 1417545335 18<19Fireye18>	bluenemo: It's one or the other.  Last indicates that nginx will do a new location search based on your regex.  You need to then issue a permanent redirect inside the location that it ends up finding.
T 1417545367 18<19Fireye18>	FatShack: If you use a regex location, sure.  Look up negative lookahead/behinds
T 1417545473 18<29FatShack18>	Fireye: Yeah, messing around with that. Problem right now is I'm using autoindex in that directory. If I turn on the negative lookahead regex it blocks access to the index as well, since that index doesn't have that character.
T 1417545475 18<19Fireye18>	d1plo1d: Sounds like you have an issue with name resolution.  If you specify IP, it'd probably work A-OK, or ensure that even though the host is down, it can be resolved
T 1417545693 18<29d1plo1d18>	Fireye: ok, that's awesome. Yeah we were using domain names for testing purposes but in production we'll be using ip's. I'll try swapping domains for ips and see if we don't have the same issue. Cheers!

T 1417550660 18<19Fireye18>	bluenemo:  Basically, a map allows you to set another variable, and you can use regex captures to pick  and choose portions of the original variable value to fill in the new mapped variable value
T 1417550776 18<19Fireye18>	switchflip: I haven't tested how truly round-robin the default configuration is.  I'd suggest taking a look at your access logs, and seeing if there is a discernable pattern.  Keep in mind that each request to nginx for that upstream, including assets like jpg and javascript, might go to a different backend
T 1417550800 18<19Fireye18>	so if you're saying it isn't round robin based on the html output, that isn't the best way to determine it IMO

T 1417566092 18<25Cope18>	Fireye: that's the point of passenger, unless I am gravely misunderstanding.  There is no backend.  Passenger functions as a module within nginx, which embeds a ruby interpreter in the webserver.

T 1417566741 18<29teward18>	Fireye: it also doesn't help that the Nginx community doesn't endorse 'Passenger'.  (I believe also there's no support on it in channel, per that last factoid, and for Passenger assistance they might want to try #passenger)

T 1417567322 18<19Fireye18>	dunkel2: nginx will want to serve data out, and though api.domain.com doesn't match nothing.domain.com, it's still listening on port 80, so it'll serve it from api.domain.com.  You should either have a catch-all type of server configuration, or detect if people are coming in from an invalid hostname (ie; if ($http_host != api.domain.com) { return 302 http://api.domain.com;}

T 1417567431 18<19Fireye18>	acmehandle:  nginx is generally more responsive and better at dealing with high load, compared to apache.  Other than that, the caching you can use is also helpful.
