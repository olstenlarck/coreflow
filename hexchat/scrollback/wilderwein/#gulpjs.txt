T 1418993408 18<22Industrial18>	I have a problem with it: I've npm published id-project so I can just include it as a dependency and add a gulpfile that requires the module and configures the steps that are enabled/disabled and the paths for everything.

T 1419628599 18<27Respek18>	hi all, I have a bit of a problem..
T 1419628650 18<27Respek18>	it'd seem that someone on my team was a little bit sloppy, and edited the compiled style.css directly, quite a bit in fact
T 1419628679 18<27Respek18>	so now, I have to apply all of those changes to the scss to get the site working properly
T 1419628692 18<27Respek18>	any ideas on a strategy to approach that with?
T 1419629630 18<25ben-eb18>	i would probably save the modified one into a new file, then run your compile step again, beautify both files and then diff the output
T 1419629805 18<19ben-eb_18>	and um... document your build process better so that it doesn't happen again :)
T 1419629899 18<19ben-eb_18>	and make sure they read it :D
