T 1419638634 18<29maxi18>	its not really just a simple form validation that can be done with firebase rules.. so i need some other layer on the serverside

T 1419638848 18<22Jan-18>	I created a batch file called node.bat and wondered why I got odd results when I tried to run node foo.js

T 1419638960 18<22Jan-18>	it seems pretty straightforward
T 1419638965 18<22Jan-18>	it's an interpreter and an API
T 1419639000 18<22Jan-18>	I'm not sure if it's reasonable to expect it to spool whole wave files through
T 1419639011 18<22Jan-18>	but then it uses the v8 interpreter, doesn't it?
T 1419639152 18<29deltab18>	yes
T 1419639181 18<22Jan-18>	some of these wave files are 50 megs
T 1419639209 18<29deltab18>	what do you want to do to them?
T 1419639227 18<22Jan-18>	it's a linear timecode analyser
T 1419639239 18<29deltab18>	could it work on a stream?
T 1419639261 18<29deltab18>	node's good with stream, I understand
T 1419639265 18<22Jan-18>	basically it takes wave files with no broadcast timecode header, reads an audio based timecode signal out of the actual waveform data, and creates a new file with the timecode header and one or more of the input tracks.
T 1419639313 18<22Jan-18>	so at some point, I do need to spool through all the audio.
T 1419639329 18<22Jan-18>	right now I actually do that with mplayer, so I could keep doing that, but it involves intermediate files and messiness.
T 1419639339 18<29deltab18>	yep, but you could do that on a stream
T 1419639348 18<29deltab18>	read a block, write a block, repeat
T 1419639355 18<22Jan-18>	I only actually need to piece through the headers.
T 1419639399 18<22Jan-18>	actually we do have the intention of making it parse the audio data.
T 1419639413 18<22Jan-18>	in a wave file, the audio channels are just interleaved byte by byte, so I may need to spin through that too.

T 1419641028 18<29deltab18>	and node has lots and lots of library modules
T 1419641043 18<22Jan-18>	but their approach is something like "process.argv.forEach(function(val,index,array){console.log(val);});

T 1419641155 18<22Jan-18>	yes, but the latter syntax is javascript, whereas the former is something some nutball made up

T 1419641192 18<29deltab18>	Jan-: also javascript; it's flexible enough for you to do all kinds of styles

T 1419641264 18<29deltab18>	it didn't exist when she learnt javascript, therefore it's unnatural :-)
T 1419641273 18<22Jan-18>	I don't find it used a lot.
T 1419641286 18<22Jan-18>	Anyway, I'm certainly *aware* of it.
T 1419641294 18<25Havvy18>	It's part of the ECMAScript specification.
T 1419641387 18<22Jan-18>	I think I can probably just port my commandline thing right across
T 1419641395 18<25Havvy18>	Note also how it's half the size as the latter.
T 1419641395 18<22Jan-18>	although it's got some odd code in it
T 1419641440 18<26blackkbot18>	what its pretty common
T 1419641453 18<26blackkbot18>	well map is maybe not forEach
T 1419641494 18*	25Havvy doesn't want to read through code showing the low level mechanics of iteration when its the fact you are iterating that is important.
T 1419641546 18<29deltab18>	in python it's just  for val in process.argv: print val

T 1419641603 18<22Sorella18>	Jan-: map/foreach/etc. are all fairly common. In fact, they *are* the default in all languages with support for higher-order programming: JavaScript, Ruby, etc.
T 1419641617 18<26blackkbot18>	thats not that bad Jan-
T 1419641625 18<22Jan-18>	so that would check if it had a function called something like checksSanityBoolean
T 1419641631 18<29deltab18>	yup
T 1419641632 18<22Jan-18>	bah
T 1419641650 18<22Sorella18>	Jan-: why not just call the function?
T 1419641672 18<29deltab18>	it might not exist!
T 1419641678 18<22Sorella18>	If it doesn't exist, it'll give you an error. If you check with an if statement you can't magically add that function anyway
T 1419641689 18<22Sorella18>	So crashing everything is the only sensible outcome in both cases
T 1419641692 18<22Jan-18>	if it fails that it'll throw(Commandline.exception('Internal error: no checker function for argument ' + this.id + ' of type ' + ARG_ALLOWEDTYPES[this.type]));
T 1419641706 18<25Havvy18>	If you want interfaces and some compile time checking, you could take a look at TypeScript.
T 1419641709 18<22Jan-18>	although all those ERROR_MSGS are global.
T 1419641735 18<22Jan-18>	I can fix that
T 1419641763 18<22Sorella18>	Jan-: if the method doesn't exist, you'll get a `Error(can't call method "name" of <object description>)`, which is basically what you have there
T 1419641792 18<22Jan-18>	yeah I know.
T 1419641805 18<22Jan-18>	the idea is that this commandline arguments thing is quite completist, it tries to be helpfup
T 1419641822 18<22Jan-18>	so there's a lot of checking that won't necessarily help people who are using software that uses the lib, but it will help a programmer set it up right.
T 1419641908 18<25Havvy18>	Jan-:  I'd also suggest using `!==` instead of `!=` even when (especially when?) it makes no difference
T 1419641924 18<22Jan-18>	hmm, yeah, you're right
T 1419642009 18<22Jan-18>	I guess there are already lots of commandline things for node.
